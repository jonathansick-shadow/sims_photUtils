# CONCLUSION: don't  bother using bandpass's manyMagCalc function. Use Sed's instead.
# the memory management required for bandpass's function seems to make it *slower* than doing the magnitude calculation
# in the straight-forward manner. (actually, Bandpass's manyMagCalc function has been removed).

# Otherwise, the manyMagCalc function speeds up magnitude calculation by about 0.7 times
#  (if the filter-by-filter magnitude calculation was done in a smart way, using the same wavelength grid
#  for all stars when they were read in and pre-calculating the MW dust extinction).
#  Could calculate 6 magnitudes with dust extinction for 10,000 stars in 24 s without manyMagCalc,
#    and in 17 s using manyMagCalc.

# Note: if you did not pre-calculate the dust extinction and did not place the stars seds onto
# the same wavelength grid as the bandpass before starting any calculations, this would increase
# the time requirements.

This test turned out so badly that I removed these methods from Bandpass.
Basically, it was slower than just the normal calculation above, and took up too much memory.

Code kept here as example. Replace the next two def's into Bandpass if you need to use this for
some bizarre reason.

## Bonus, many-magnitude calculation for many SEDs with a single bandpass
##  Note: testing of these functions indicate that this is NOT a good optimization.
##  Use these if you have to, but it is SLOWER than just calculating a magnitude a normal way, and
##  definitely slower than using Sed's manyMagCalc function.

        case it's ever useful. 

        This method assumes that there will be flux within a particular bandpass
        (could return '-Inf' for a magnitude if there is none), and use setupFnuArray first, on this
        bandpass itself or on another bandpass with the same wavelength grid (i.e. here it is assumed that
        the wavelength grid is correct).
        Also assumes that phi has already been calculated for this bandpass (using self.sbTophi()). 
        These assumptions are to avoid error checking within this function (for speed), but could lead
        to errors if method is used incorrectly.
        ATTENTION - testing has proved that this is slower than any normal mag calculation.
